            <h1>Hello, I am Jerry Yu, a UX/UI designer with a Biological Science background.</h1>
            <p>I was trained for more than 6 months in the UX/UI Bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine, once I acquired my Master of Science degree specializing in Biotechnology. My UX/UI experiences focused on webpage redesigning and my research experience focused on immunology. 

                I aim to bring user-oriented UIs to Biotechnological products.</p>
